-- ========================================
-- Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) Setup
-- ========================================
-- This script enables RLS on all tables and creates policies
-- that allow your backend (service_role) to access everything
-- while blocking unauthorized direct database access.
--
-- HOW TO USE:
-- 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
-- 2. Create new query
-- 3. Copy-paste this entire file
-- 4. Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter
-- ========================================

-- ========================================
-- DONE! Your database is now secure.
-- ========================================
-- What this does:
-- ‚úÖ Blocks unauthorized direct database access
-- ‚úÖ Allows your backend API (using service_role key) to work normally
-- ‚úÖ Tables now show üõ°Ô∏è shield icon instead of "unrestricted"
--
-- Verify:
-- 1. Go to Database ‚Üí Tables in Supabase Dashboard
-- 2. Tables should show shield icon (RLS enabled)
-- 3. Click a table ‚Üí Policies tab ‚Üí Should see "Service role..." policy
