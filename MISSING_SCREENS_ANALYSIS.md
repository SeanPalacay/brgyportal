## 🚨 **CRITICAL MISSING PAGES**

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Breaks User Flows)

| **Role Management** | `/admin/users/roles` | Section 1: Authentication & Role Management | SYSTEM_ADMIN | Cannot manage user roles and permissions |
| **Backup Management** | `/admin/settings/backup` | Section 9: System Administration | SYSTEM_ADMIN | Cannot perform data backups |
| **SK Analytics Dashboard** | `/sk/analytics` | Section 5: SK Engagement Module | SK_CHAIRMAN | Cannot view participation analytics |

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Referenced in Sidebar/Flows)

| Page | Route | User Story Reference | User Role | Impact |
|------|-------|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| **Broadcast Message Management** | `/admin/settings/notifications` | Section 6: Notification System | SYSTEM_ADMIN | Cannot send broadcast messages |

## 🔧 **ROUTE CONFIGURATION ISSUES**

### **Incorrect Route Mappings**

1. **Announcements Route Mismatch**
   - **Current**: Admin sidebar → `/announcements` (public view)
   - **Should be**: Admin sidebar → `/admin/announcements` (admin management)
   - **Fix**: Create admin announcements page + update sidebar

2. **Missing Patient Access to Own Health Data**
   - **Issue**: Patients cannot access their own appointments
   - **Current**: `/health/appointments` restricted to BHW only
   - **Fix**: Allow PATIENT role access with filtered data

3. **Sidebar References Non-Existent Routes**
   - `/admin/users/roles` - Referenced but not implemented
   - `/admin/settings/backup` - Referenced but not implemented
   - `/admin/settings/notifications` - Referenced but not implemented
   - `/reports/analytics` - Referenced but not implemented
   - `/sk/analytics` - Referenced but not implemented
   - `/reports/health/stats` - Referenced but not implemented
